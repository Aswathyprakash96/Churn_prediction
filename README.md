# üìä Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes customer usage details such as call minutes, charges, customer service calls, and subscription plans.

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned string columns (e.g., `International plan`, `Voice mail plan`) and mapped to binary
- One-hot encoded `State` column
- Outlier detection (IQR method)
- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Handling Class Imbalance

Used **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset since churned customers are fewer.

---

## üîç Feature Selection

Used `SelectKBest` with `chi2` score function to select top k features that are most relevant for churn prediction.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=10)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_resampled, y_resampled)

üß† Model Training
Trained multiple classifiers:
RandomForestClassifier
LogisticRegression
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)


üìà Model Evaluation
Used the following metrics:
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-score
